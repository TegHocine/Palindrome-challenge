Program to check whether palindrome can be formed after deleting at most k characters or not

Suppose we have a string S, we have to check whether we can make this string a palindrome of minimum 3 char's after deleting at most k characters or not, then return the deleted char's is possible to get a palindrome else return not possible.

So, if the input is like S= "lieuvrel", then the output will be "iuv", we can delete three characters to get palindrome "lerel".
